# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

# Description
# The goal is to develop a system for detecting anomalies in network traffic data.
# Anomalies in network traffic can indicate potential security threats.
# Machine learning techniques will be utilized to identify unusual patterns.

# Approach
# Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection.
# Some options include isolation forests, one-class SVMs, or deep autoencoders.
# Research and compare the performance of these algorithms in the context of network traffic anomaly detection.

# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the network traffic data
data = pd.read_csv("network_traffic.csv")

# Preprocess the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Choose a machine learning algorithm
algorithm = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)

# Train the algorithm
algorithm.fit(scaled_data)

# Predict anomalies in the data
predictions = algorithm.predict(scaled_data)

# Evaluate the performance of the algorithm
print(classification_report(data["label"], predictions))
