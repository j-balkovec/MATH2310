```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sample Code
```{r}
# a now holds the value of 2 and b holds the value of 5
a <- 2 
b <- 5
c <- a * b
d <- a ^ b
```

## Loading a library
```{r}
library(readxl)
```

## Reading the data
```{r}
column_names <- c("trial_num", "diet", "pct_weight_change", "efficiency", "acid_det_fiber")

df <- read_excel("Snowgeese.xls", col_names=column_names)
```

## Subseting the Dataframe
```{r}
weight_change_plants <- df[df$diet == "Plants", "pct_weight_change"]
acid_diet_plants <- df[df$diet == "Plants", "acid_det_fiber"]
```

## Plot
```{r}
plot(
  x=acid_diet_plants$acid_det_fiber,
  y=weight_change_plants$pct_weight_change,
  xlab="Acid Detergent Fiber",
  ylab="Percent Weight Change",
)
```
