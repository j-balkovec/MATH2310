# Tic Tac Toe [TITLE]

One of my project in my dynmaic memory managment *(CPSC 1430)* class was a simple Tic-Tac-Toe implementation. I took that implementation a step further. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence I decided to implement it in my Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The "AI" model runs on a recursive RNG and an input validation basis.

## Features

Human vs. human gameplay
Human vs. computer gameplay

## Requirements
* This project requires a C++ compiler to build and run.

## Building and Running
* To build the program, navigate to the project directory and enter the following command in your terminal or command prompt:   g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp board.cpp player.cpp player.h board.h -o tictactoe

* To run the program, enter the following command:    ./tictactoe

<<<OR>>>

* type "make" into the terminal and then run ./tictactoe

## Usage
* The game will prompt you to enter the name and symbol for each player at the beginning of the game. You will then be prompted to make moves by entering the row and column of the square where you want to place your symbol.

* If you are playing against the computer, the computer will make its moves automatically using a random move strategy.

* The game ends when one player wins or the board is filled with no winner. You will be prompted to play again or quit.

## Future Work
* Add more features
* Make the AI smarter
* Improve memory usage
* Turn it into an app
