- Log Levels: Define different levels of logging to categorize the severity of log messages. 
  Common log levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each log level represents 
  a different level of importance or severity.

- Logging Configuration: Allow configuration options to specify log level, log format, log output 
  destination, and other settings. This allows users to customize the behavior of the logger based 
  on their requirements.
  
- Timestamps: Include timestamps in log messages to provide a reference point for when the log event occurred.
  This helps in debugging and analysis.
  
- Log Formatting: Provide a customizable log format that allows users to specify how log messages should be structured.
  The format may include information such as timestamp, log level, module name, line number, and the actual log message.
  
- Logging to Multiple Destinations: Allow logging to different output destinations, such as console, files, 
  or external services. This enables flexibility in handling log messages based on specific use cases or
  deployment scenarios.
  
- Rotating Log Files: Support log file rotation to prevent log files from becoming too large. Log 
  rotation can be based on file size, a specific time interval, or a combination of both.
  
- Thread Safety: Ensure thread safety when multiple threads or processes are logging concurrently. 
  This is important to prevent race conditions and ensure that log messages are written accurately.
  
- Exception Logging: Include functionality to log exceptions and stack traces when errors occur.
  This can aid in identifying and diagnosing issues during troubleshooting.
  
- Filtering: Allow log messages to be filtered based on specific criteria, such as log level,
  module, or custom filters. Filtering can help reduce log noise and focus on relevant log events.
  
- Integration with Existing Logging Frameworks: Provide integration with existing logging frameworks or 
  libraries commonly used in the Python ecosystem, such as the standard logging module. This allows 
  users to leverage existing tools and functionalities seamlessly.
  
- Performance Considerations: Implement efficient logging mechanisms to minimize the impact on application performance.
  This involves optimizing log message handling, minimizing I/O operations, and considering buffering strategies.

- Documentation: Include clear and comprehensive documentation on how to use the logger, its configuration options, 
  and best practices. This helps users understand the logger's capabilities and how to integrate it into their projects 
  effectively.
