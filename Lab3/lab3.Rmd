## Activity One

##### <strong>[Question A]</strong> - <i>Put together a summary of the cloud seeding data, including the mean, standard deviation, and five-number summary for each of the two groups (seeded and unseeded clouds).</i>
***
###### <strong> [Answer A] - Seeded </strong>
```{r}
create_summary_table(seeded)
```
***
###### <strong> [Answer A] - Unseeded </strong>
```{r}
create_summary_table(unseeded)
```
***
##### <strong> [Question A] </strong> <i>Of these numerical summaries, which are the most appropriate to use in describing this data? Why?</i>

I think it's challenging to determine which summary is the most appropriate since all of them provide valuable insights into the provided data.

- <strong>Mean</strong>: It gives us the average rainfall across both treatment groups, which is useful but may be skewed by outliers (as evident in the dataset).

- <strong>Standard Deviation</strong>: The standard deviation seems quite high right off the bat. This suggests considerable variability in the dataset and a wide range of values from the average.

- <strong>Five-Number Summary</strong>: This one might seem the most useful as it provides a decent amount of information about the data. The **median** (Q2) gives us an idea of the middle point of the dataset, while the quartiles (**Q1** and **Q3**) provide insights into the spread of the data. The **minimum** and **maximum** represent the range of rainfall observations, indicating potential outliers at both extremes.

To conclude, I believe the <strong>Five-Number Summary</strong> is the most appropriate summary to describe the clouds dataset.

##### <strong> [Question B] </strong> - <i>Construct comparative boxplots for the cloud seeding data.</i>

***
###### <strong> [Answer B] - Boxplot </strong>
```{r}
# Create a boxplot
plot_rainfall_boxplot(data_frame, log=TRUE)
```

***
###### <strong> [Answer B] </strong>

- **Unseeded Clouds:**
  - **Summary:** The unseeded clouds have a mean rainfall of approximately **164.59 mm** with a standard deviation of **278.43 mm**.<br>
  
  - **Five-Number Summary:** The data range from a minimum of 1 mm to a maximum of **1202.6 mm**. The median rainfall (Q2) is **44.2 mm**, and the interquartile range (IQR) is from **24.4 mm** (Q1) to **163 mm** (Q3).

- **Seeded Clouds:**
  - **Summary:** The seeded clouds show a higher mean rainfall of around **441.98 mm** but with a larger standard deviation of **650.79 mm**.<br>
  
  - **Five-Number Summary:** The seeded cloud data range from a minimum of **4.1 mm** to a maximum of **2745.6 mm**. The median rainfall (Q2) is **221.6 mm**, and the IQR extends from **92.4 mm** (Q1) to **430 mm** (Q3).

- **Observations:**
  - **Effectiveness:** The mean rainfall for seeded clouds is noticeably higher than that for unseeded clouds, suggesting that cloud seeding increases rainfall. However, the large standard deviation for seeded clouds indicates a high variability in the observed rainfall data, which may imply inconsistent effectiveness or some other influencing factors.<br>
  
  - **Outliers:** Seeded clouds exhibit more extreme values, with a maximum rainfall almost double that of unseeded clouds. This suggests that while cloud seeding may increase overall rainfall, it also has the potential to produce some more [extreme weather events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_tropical_cyclone_rainfall_climatology#:~:text=The%20average%20storm%20total%20rainfall,within%20a%2024â€‘hour%20period.).<br>
  
  - **Interpretation:** While the mean rainfall for seeded clouds appears higher, further analysis would be needed to determine the significance of this difference and the reliability of cloud seeding as a "rainfall increase approach/method".

## Activity Two

##### <strong> [Question A] </strong><i>Put together a summary of the log transformed cloud seeding data, including the mean, standard deviation, and five-number summary for each of the two groups (seeded and unseeded clouds).</i>
***
```{r}
log_seeded <- data_frame$Log_Rainfall[data_frame$Treatment == "Seeded"]
log_unseeded <- data_frame$Log_Rainfall[data_frame$Treatment == "Unseeded"]
```
***

###### <strong> [Answer A] - Log Seeded </strong>
```{r}
create_summary_table(log_seeded)
```
***

###### <strong> [Answer A] - Log Unseeded </strong>
```{r}
create_summary_table(log_unseeded)
```
***

##### <strong> [Question A] </strong> <i>Of these numerical summaries, which are the most appropriate to use in describing this data? Why?</i>

###### <strong> [Answer A] </strong>

- **Mean**: The mean of the log-transformed data gives us a measure of central tendency, indicating the average value of the data points on the log scale.

- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the log-transformed data measures the spread or variability of the data points around the mean on the log scale. It tells us how much the data deviates from the mean value.

- **Five-Number Summary**: This one might not be the most useful as we can't rely on the minimum or the maximum. That doesn't necessarily mean the other values in the Five-Number Summary are useless. We can focus on **Q1**, **Median (Q2)**, and **Q3**. These quartiles provide us with information about the spread and distribution of the data across different percentiles on a log scale.

Again, to conclude, I believe a combination of the **Mean**, **SD**, and the **Five-Number Summary (excluding Min and Max)** is the most appropriate summary to describe the clouds dataset.
